### [Figma Mockup](https://www.figma.com/file/kio4M5j8knHbYe3QFSQtm0/RDC?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=JuGdJsryJHyTjaAj-1)  

## Installation

```shell
git clone https://github.com/RDC-UCF/club-site.git
cd club-site
npm install
```

## Getting Started

To run a live development server, run the following in a terminal:

```shell
npm run dev
```

This will host the website locally. As you make updates to the
code, the development server will automatically reload the page.

If you get errors, try running `npm install`. Different branches might have
different dependencies installed, so running a fresh `npm install` after each
branch switch is advisable.

## Stack

These are the technologies used for the site and their purpose.

### Vite

The purpose of Vite is to provide a fast and efficient development server and build tool for modern web applications. It leverages native ES modules to enable instant server startup and fast hot module replacement (HMR) during development. Vite also supports a highly optimized production build process, generating optimized and tree-shaken bundles for deployment. With Vite, developers can enjoy a smooth and productive development experience while building performant web applications.

### Vue

In order to be able to work on this project, you'll need to be familiar with
Vue. Vue is a progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. It allows you to declaratively render HTML templates with data bindings, making it easier to manage and manipulate the UI on the page. If you're not familiar with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you should learn those first so that Vue makes more sense.

### Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS is a CSS utility library. It provides useful prebuilt CSS classes
that enable simple and effective styling without dealing with separate
stylesheets. Tailwind CSS also provides responsive variants of classes to make
it easier to build a webpage that adapts to any screen size. It feels most like
inline CSS styles in regular HTML.

### Typescript

Typescript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. It adds optional static types to JavaScript, which can help catch errors and provide better tooling for large-scale JavaScript applications. It allows you to write cleaner and more maintainable code by providing features such as type checking, interfaces, and classes. Typescript is used in this project to enhance the development experience and improve code quality.
